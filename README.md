# Game - Python Programming Competition

This game was created for my university programming competition.


## 1 - Task

Improve and extend either the Squash or the Android-Apple game developed in the lectures on 14th and 21st November. 

## 2 - Rules


Use only Python and the graphics module. Don't write (object-oriented) classes and do not use non-standard libraries such as PyGame - any modules you use apart from graphics.py must be part of the standard Python 3 distribution. However, if you want to add sound, I suggest using the winsound module (this only works on WIndows, but you can assume that we will use a Windows computer to run your program). Do not re-write the game completely - it should still involve bat(s)/ball or an android eating apples (but of course, it could do other things as well!). Keep to the spirit of the unit and the competition, and make sure that your game would not offend anyone.

## 3 - Judging

Your program will be judged on: 

+ (mainly) the scale, imagination, fun and playability of the game
+ (but also) code readability (including improvements to the supplied code).

#Deadline: 18-December
